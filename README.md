# Project Idea

I was learning English and every time I encountered with a word that was strange to me, I was looking to its meaning from dictionaries. It was difficult, repetitive and unnecessary. Because of my own necessity and problem I developed this project.

Previously, Ã–mer Faruk Bayram had written a similar project. But he deleted the project. So I wrote it from scratch.
